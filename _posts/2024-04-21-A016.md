# Sumo Digital Visit
We're going to be having our next **Sumo Digital Visit** with members from Hallam GameDevSoc next Week!

&nbsp;

Just as a quick reminder, it'll be a fairly relaxed visit where we'll watch a GDC (Game Development Conference) talk with some snacks, get to talk to employees about what they do, and receive feedback on any work you've done **(I highly recommend you bring along anything you've worked on even if isn't great!!)**

&nbsp;

We only have a limited number of places (at **10 people**) for the visit, so it'll be a case of first come, first served. However, there'll be one more visit in may, so you'll still have a chance to come along.

&nbsp;

The visit will take place on the **24/04/24** from **4 - 6pm**, so if you'd like to come fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUTpKNjaKzOOSucp3c-kFgDZNatDUTU-wXOOZ1qWPCLPgMbg/viewform) ASAP to not miss your chance! Remember, you **must** be a society member to attend.

&nbsp;

# Hope to see you at our next Sumo visit and our new events next academic year!
