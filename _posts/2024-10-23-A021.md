## This Week's Session

We'll be continuing on the platforming game from last week and adding an Enemy, UI and Menus. If you haven't been able to attend any of our sessions, we will be able to guide you through a video tutorial that covers similar content to what we've done in the past 3 weeks.

Also, don't worry if you were working on the web version of Godot and don't have any files from last week; we'll provide a premade game to continue on from.

**When:** Thursday, 5 - 7 PM
**Where:** Computer Room 4, The Diamond

*If you're not a University of Sheffield member, please DM me so I can inform security and get you access.*
