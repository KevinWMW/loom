## Interest & Feedback Form

For some upcoming events, we've prepared a quick form to figure out how many people and on if there's any interest in weekly meetups where we book out a room to make games together. We've also left some space to give us feedback on the GIAG or if there are any topics you'd like to see covered in our sessions in the future.

If you have the time to fill this in it'd help us a lot of with planning
