## This Week's Session
This week, we'll be covering the basics of how to use Blender from producing a simple model, editing it to produce finer features and applying textures to get the exact look you want! All you'll need is a laptop with Blender installed to follow along in person, but we'll post up the slides on the day for anyone that wants to go over it at home.

Next week we'll go more in depth on how to improve your Blender skills with Sculpting, Retopology and Baking (we'll explain on the day what these are) so make sure to keep an eye out after this first session!

Just like last week, we'll be in **Classroom 1**, **Diamond** this **Thursday from 5:30 - 7:00pm** for the session!

# Hope to see you there soon :)
