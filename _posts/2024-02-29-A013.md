Hey everyone,
# Week 4 Announcements
## This Week's Session
We're going to be running a session on Pixel Art tips & tricks this week, where we'll be working with Aseprite to practice some of the techniques that we will cover in the session. 

If you don't have Aseprite, you can get a free version called Libresprite by going to the attached link and downloading the correct version for your system. 

We recommend bringing a mouse to this session as it would make drawing easier, although it's not necessary.

Just like last week, we'll be in **Classroom 1 in the Diamond** this **Thursday (tomorrow) from 5:30 - 7:00pm**!

## Composer looking for Work
We have someone looking for opportunities to write music for any games you're working on! 
If you're interested, please email dlockwood1@sheffield.ac.uk .

# Hope to see you at our weekly session!
