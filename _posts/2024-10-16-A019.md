## This Week's Session

This week, we'll be working on the basic platforming game we started in Week 1 and adding new functionality to it by making use of GDScript. As we'll be coding some functionality into the game, it'd be a good idea to brush up on your coding skills before Thursday.

Don't worry if you were working on the web version of godot and don't have any files from Week 1, we'll provide a premade game to continue on from.

üóìÔ∏è When: Thursday, 5 - 7 PM
üìç Where: Computer Room 4, The Diamond

*If you're not a University of Sheffield member, please DM me so I can inform security and get you access.*
