## Weekly Session - Making Music with Reaper
This week we will be looking into making video game music using reaper. We will start off with some basic music theory, video game specific case studies and then diving into making our own music using reaper. Make sure to come along! 

**When:** Thursday, 5 - 7 PM
**Where:** Computer Room 4, The Diamond

*If you're not a University of Sheffield member, please DM one of committee or email us so we can inform security and get you access.*

## Wednesday Meetups
Join us in a dedicated room where members can work on their own projects, work with other developers, and enjoy a supportive atmosphere. If there is enough requests for it, I can also spend time covering niche stuff that people need help with in these meetups.

Thereâ€™ll be free snacks too :)

**When:** Wednesdays, 2 - 4 PM
**Where:** Classroom 6 - G09, 38 Mappin Street
