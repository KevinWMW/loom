And some paragraph text. Now for an image:

<!-- Here is how you include an image in a post. Place an image in /resources/images, set 'filename' to the name of the file without the extension, add a description for people using screen readers, optionally add a caption, and optionally add a source, which the caption will link to if set. -->
{% include figure.liquid 
  filename="001" 
  description="An archival photograph of a partially rolled up rectangle of fine dun-colored linen cloth with a fringe along the bottom edge. On the left side there's a dark rectangular figure woven into the fabric." 
  caption="Linen cloth with fringe, 304 BC-AD 364" 
  source="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/557667"
%}

And a bit more text beneath the image. How about a horizontal rule?
