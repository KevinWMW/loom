# Sumo Digital Studio Visit
We're excited to let you all know that we're going to be having more visits to Sumo Digital, alongside students from the **Sheffield Hallam GameDevSoc**!

It'll be a fairly relaxed visit where we'll watch a GDC (Game Development Conference) talk with some snacks, get to talk to employees about what they do, and possibly receive feedback on any work you've done.

Just as a side note, Sumo had to handle some bookkeeping with Health & Safety, so we couldn't put this out as early as we would've liked. For future visits, we'll announce well in advance.

We only have a limited number of places (**10 people**) for this month's visit due to studio-specific events, so it'll be a case of first come, first served this time around. However, there'll be more visits, so you'll still have a chance to come along.

The visit will take place on the **20/03/24 from 4 - 6pm**, so if you'd like to come, fill out this form ASAP to not miss your chance! Remember, you **must** be a society member to attend. 

More details around transport and location will be released closer to the event. 

# Hope to see you at the Sumo Digital Studio soon :)
