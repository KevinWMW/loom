## Weekly Session

**When: ** Thursday, 5 - 7 PM
**Where:** Computer Room 4, The Diamond

*If you're not a University of Sheffield member, please DM one of committee or email us so we can inform security and get you access.*

## Wednesday Meetups
As we finish the Godot sessions, we're opening up the weekly meetups again.

Join us in a dedicated room where members can work on their own projects, work with other devs, and enjoy a supportive atmosphere. If there is enough requests for it, I can also spend time covering niche stuff that people need help with in these meetups.

Thereâ€™ll be free snacks too :)

**When:** Wednesdays, 2 - 4 PM
**Where:** Classroom 6 - G09, 38 Mappin Street **(We got a room!)**

## Sumo Digital Studio Visit
We're going to be having our first Sumo Digital visit this Wednesday!

Just as a quick reminder, it'll be a fairly relaxed visit where we'll watch a GDC (Game Development Conference) talk with some snacks, get to talk to employees about what they do, see what they're working on and receive feedback on any work you've done **(I highly recommend you bring along anything you've worked on even if isn't great!!)**

We're going to meet up at the room for the weekly meetups to make our way there via tram at 3:30pm, so I'd recommend coming to room by 3:25pm . If you'd rather make your own way, you can just head straight there for 4pm (**we will need to check if you filled in the form to come though**). If you can no longer make it please let us know **ASAP** so we can let others come instead.

**When:** Wednesday, 30/10/24,  4 - 6 PM
**Where:** 32 Jessops Riverside, Sheffield, S9 2RX
