## Weekly Session - Pixel Art : Tips, Theory & Practice
This week we'll be going over the basics of how to draw pixel art, techniques that can help you as you get better at it and theory on how to draw for games specifically. For the session if you have a laptop, make sure to download either [Libresprite](https://libresprite.github.io/) for free or [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) if you have some money for it. Don't worry if you don't have one though, as we'll provide software you can work with on the university computers :)

**When:** Thursday, 5 - 7 PM
**Where:** Computer Room 4, The Diamond

*If you're not a University of Sheffield member, please DM one of committee or email us so we can inform security and get you access.*

## Wednesday Meetups
Join us in a dedicated room where members can work on their own projects, work with other developers, and enjoy a supportive atmosphere. If there is enough requests for it, I can also spend time covering niche stuff that people need help with in these meetups.

Thereâ€™ll be free snacks too :)

**When:** Wednesdays, 2 - 4 PM
**Where:** Classroom 6 - G09, 38 Mappin Street
