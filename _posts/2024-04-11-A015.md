# Upcoming AGM
Hey all,

We're going to be having our AGM on the **18th of April**, from **17:30** in **Classroom 5** in the **38 Mappin Street Building**.

&nbsp;

An AGM is where you have the opportunity to put yourself forward for any role in our committee, including any that are currently held by others. If you'd like to put yourself forward for a role you can head to [this link](https://forms.gle/WewoWtddhxFfNPcE9) to fill in your info. 

&nbsp;

## [Committee Application Form](https://forms.gle/WewoWtddhxFfNPcE9)

&nbsp;

For more information on the available roles and their responsibilities you can head to [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GdlJN_230NieoTEFDytZOTbZs4o8sow9avNz6RI3DE/edit?usp=sharing).

&nbsp;

Other than that we'll be in the Classroom next week when candidates can say a speech if they feel like, but if you don't think you'd be able to show up or would rather not say a speech it'd be nice if you could send us an image via  our email [gamedev.soc@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:gamedev.soc@sheffield.ac.uk)

&nbsp;


A good chunk of our committee is leaving this year so it'd be great if you're willing to step up and take up a role for next year.

&nbsp;

# We look forward to seeing your applications!!
