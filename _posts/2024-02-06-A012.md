# What is Shef Jam
 Shef Jam is a big 48 hour game jam being hosted by CompSoc with prizes, events and free meals throughout.

It's happening next week (Fri 9th Feb at 6MP- Sunday 11th Feb at 2PM) and we're exited to collaborate with Comp Soc on it!

We have some free tickets for GameDevSoc members that we released on 1pm Sunday, and 40% of our stock has already sold out!

# How much does it cost
The event is FREE for Game Dev Members, and this might be your last opportunity to get tickets, since all other ticket releases quickly sold out!

# What will GameDevSoc be doing?
Game Dev Soc committee will be around for most of the competition happy to help, and we will be running a couple of design and social competitions for anyone to take part in.
